# bloons tower defense clone?
Game allowing the user to place towers on the screen which are immobile using a currency. Along a pretermined path enemies travel from one side of the screen to the other. The towers placed can throw projectiles at said enemy in order to remove it from the path and gain more currency. These enemies, or "bloons" move at differing speeds to one another based on color, and attacking or "popping" it removes a layer, each layer is a different color and thus a different speed.
